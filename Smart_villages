The Smart Village Concept:
     In initial phase just thinking about the farmers, but will soon take step in Childrens and Womens betterment.

      Initial idea:-   
      The ideas to make village better place.
      (1) Provide Daily Weather information.
      (2) Make an video portal from where farmers could fetch the videos about things they need related to agriculture.
      (3) SMS-based help.
      (4) Provide an option to schedule call-back request in case of any help.
      (5) Regural update the database located in the village.
      
      
      Providing internet to all the farmers will not be that much ease. We will provide farmer with an shorter URl or an IP.
      As un-directional access to the internet would harm more than to take positive use of it.
      Cosidering maximum people in the village have a normal smartphone.
      It will help farmer to make better decision if they get precise data on time and as fast as posiible.
